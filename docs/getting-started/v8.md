## `react-native-ui-lib@8.x.x`

## General
Now supports react-native 0.77  
`uilib-native` (our native library) has been moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies`.  
Make sure to `pod install` after updating.  
We do plan on making this optional in the future.

## Components

### ActionSheet
This component is affected by the Dialog migration  

### asPanViewConsumer
Removed (use `PanView` instead)  

### DateTimePicker
This component is affected by the Dialog migration  

### Dialog
The component was refactored completely with some API changes. 

Props migration:
- `helperText` -> `hint`
- `panDirection` -> `direction`
- `onDialogDismissed` -> `onDismiss`
- `pannableHeaderProps` -> `headerProps`  
  Some props from `pannableHeaderProps` has moved \ changed their name:  
  - `titleNumOfLines` -> `titleProps.numOfLines`
  - `titleAccessibilityLabel` -> `titleProps.accessibilityLabel`
  - `message` -> `subtitle`
  - `leftCustomElement` -> `leadingAccessory`
  - `rightCustomElement` -> `trailingAccessory`
  - `bottomCustomElement` -> `bottomAccessory`
- `overlayBackgroundColor` -> `modalProps.overlayBackgroundColor`
- `supportedOrientations` -> `modalProps.supportedOrientations`
- `accessibilityLabel` -> `modalProps.accessibilityLabel`
- `renderPannableHeader` -> `headerProps`


Additional notes:  
- If you have a ScrollView or FlatList as a child of the `Dialog`, make sure to import them from `react-native-gesture-handler` (see [this link](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues/1380) for `SectionList`).  
- The new onDismiss has no parameters (`() => void`)  
- If you have an issue with a touchable view inside a scrollable `Dialog` on Android, check out the disableAnimation prop.

### ExpandableOverlay (Incubator)
This component is affected by the Dialog migration  

### PanView (new)
 One component to replace all the previous views (`PanGestureView`, `PanDismissibleView`, `PanResponderView`, `PanListenerView`, `PanningProvider`, `asPanViewConsumer` and `PanningContext`).
- Use `PanView.PanningDirections.X` (or `Dialog.directions.X` where relevant) instead of `PanningProvider.Directions.X`.  

### PanDismissibleView
Removed (use `PanView` instead)

### PanGestureView
Removed (use `PanView` instead)

### PanListenerView
Removed (use `PanView` instead)

### PanningContext
Removed (use `PanView` instead)

### PanningProvider
Removed (use `PanView` instead)

### PanResponderView
Removed (use `PanView` instead)

### Picker
This component is affected by the Dialog migration  

### SharedTransition
Removed

### StackAggregator
Use the `backgroundColor` prop instead of `contentContainerStyle={{backgroundColor}}`
Fix card being transparent on Android
`onCollapseChanged` will now be called after the animation has ended (as was intended)

### Text
[iOS] In rare cases where `Text` is nested and `textAlign` is passed, you might need to pass it to the nested component as well.
```
<Text style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>This <Text>is working</Text></Text>
<Text style={{textAlign: 'right'}}><Text>This is not working</Text></Text>
<Text style={{textAlign: 'right'}}><Text>This is not</Text> working</Text>
```

### Picker
The component was refactored to simplify its API and improve type safety.

#### Migration Steps

**Picker:**

- `value` - The picker now only supports primitive values (string | number) instead of object-based values
- `migrate` - Removed

**Picker.Item:**

- Items structure remains the same: `{label: string, value: primitive}` format is unchanged
- All items now use the `label` prop directly - no custom label transformation needed
- `getItemLabel` - Removed (use `item.label` to get label)
- `getItemValue` - Removed (use `item.value` to get value)
